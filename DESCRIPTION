Description: Here we take multiple sources of input data - raw, as well as
    model estimates using the model from Schick et al. 2013 - PLoS-ONE to
    estimate and quantify the effects of entanglement events on individual
    right whale health. The goal is to examine health change across a window,
    health during a window, and the links between health and survival as
    a function of different entanglement severity classes.
