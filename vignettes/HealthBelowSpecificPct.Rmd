## Prepare the data to Examine Unimpacted Females
We decided that in order to compare the health of impacted reproductively active females we'd want to have a reference category of unimpacted but reproductively active females. So that means females that have had a calf, but who have never been entangled. Turns out this isn't a large #(!) but it gives us a useful reference class. To get that data assembled, we run this function and return its output as list elements. These will be used when we assemble the data for plotting.

```{r}
thold <- 67
tmp <- prepThreshDataUnImp(healthmean, firstSight, lastSight, thold)
```
