## Introduction
The goal of this writeup is to document the steps we've taken to make a new plot to be included in the Knowlton et al. paper. The goal of this analysis and figure is to uncover and highlight a) the progression of animals over time from a clean state to an entangled state, and b) to document if/how animals in a particular state affect the overall population health. Recall the figure from Rolland et al. (2016) that showed the median health of animals in different classes over time:



![](E:/rob/Documents/research/manuscripts/KnowltonEtAl_Entanglement/images/rollandFig4.png)

We had assembled those figures to find out what each group contributes to our overall understanding of health. For example, which group's health was worst in the late 1990's?

In the paper, we've shown how survival declines with entanglement. Here our goal is to try and sort out the contribution of entangled animals to the overall health. We will assess this contribution by entanglement class: minor, moderate, and severe. 

## Methods
The approximate workflow is as follows. For each animal in the population, for each month in the analysis window, assign an entanglement state that corresponds to the injury class. The idea here is that the animal starts 'clear' or unentangled. Upon becoming entangled, its status gets updated to the overall entanglement status. The key is that as time progresses, the animal only stays in its worst class, and doesn't recover. We'll have 5 ordinal classes:

* Class 4 - Unentangled
* Class 3 - Minor Entanglement
* Class 2 - Moderate Entanglement
* Class 1 - Severe Entanglement
* Class 0 - Known Dead (though we include this conceptually, it's not been populated yet)

For example, an animal starts in class 4. Once it becomes entangled with a minor entanglement its state is a 3. While we have been careful to define the temporal extent of the entanglement windows in the paper, here we are explicitly assuming the animal is permanently in state 3. However, should the animal experience a moderate entanglement at some future point, its state will drop to 2 and remain there, even if its health recovers. This idea is one possible way to look at the cumulative impact of entanglement burden.

### Data Processing
We have the posterior estimates of health for all animals, the entanglement windows that describe each event for each animal, and the matrix of state vectors just described. With these, we can assemble the data required for plotting. 

Here are the entanglement injury data:

```{r}
tangled <- tangleOut
tangled %>% 
  select(EGNo, EventNo, StartDateWindow, EndDateWindow, Severity, gear)
```

Note that the above table differs slightly from before in that I've specifically asked to show the start and end times of the windows that we use in the paper. These are the ones that are pared down based on the rules we derived; they are much shorter in duration than the entire possible window.

In terms of the number of distinct animals in these data, we have:

```{r}
n_distinct(tangled$EGNo)
```

**Update:** The reason this value is smaller than expected is that in the paper, we only used entanglement events across the window. There are some number of events that lack a start date. 

With the raw data, we can now build up a data structure. We populate this with 4's under the assumption that all animals start unentangled. 

```{r}
dateVec <- seq.Date(as.Date("1970/01/01"), as.Date("2016/12/01"), by = 'month')
fate <- matrix(4, nrow = length(ID), ncol = length(dateVec))
```

Now let's loop over individuals, and within individuals, entanglement events, to fill in this state matrix. 

**UPDATE** This changes slightly from the last document in that, I'm now starting the change at ```EndDateWindow``` instead of ```StartDateWindow```. I don't anticipate a major change, but we're exploring it anyway.

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(unique(tangled$EGNo))){
  eg <- unique(tangled$EGNo)[i]
  dsub <- filter(tangled, EGNo == eg) %>% 
    select(EventNo, Severity, gearInj, StartDateWindow, EndDateWindow, firstCalfidx) %>% 
    arrange(StartDateWindow)
  
  for(j in 1:nrow(dsub)){
    startPos <- which.min(abs(dateVec - as.Date(dsub$EndDateWindow[j])))
    valStart <- dsub$gearInj[j]
    if(valStart %in% c(6, 4)) val <- 3
    if(valStart %in% c(5, 2)) val <- 2
    if(valStart %in% c(3, 1)) val <- 1
    fate[i, startPos:ncol(fate)] <- val
  }

  # Update Health to exclude health of repro females 
  # from first calf (t1) to
  # remaining time in unentangled state (t2)
  if(!any(is.na(dsub$firstCalfidx))){
    anidx <- match(eg, noquote(rownames(healthmean)))
    t1 <- min(dsub$firstCalfidx)
    t2 <- max(which(fate[i, ] == 4))
    
    if(t1 < t2){
      timeAfter <- t1:t2
      healthmean[anidx, timeAfter] <- NA
    }
    
  }
  
}
```

A few things to note in the code. We start by looping over individuals based on their EGNo. We subset the entanglement data to just have the one of more events for each individual animal. When we subset, we pull out the information on the individual event, severity, time of start/stop, etc. 

We then loop over these individual events to find the ~~start~~ **end** position of the event. We then calculate the severity, lumping by category, i.e. minor - with gear (```valStart == 4```) and minor without gear ```valStart == 6``` get collapsed to a minor (3). 

From this start position until the end of the modeling time (```ncol(fate)```), we then set the states equal to the lumped severity category. If a later entanglement event has a lower category, i.e. it's a worse entanglement, then the fate gets updated from the start of _that_ event until the end of modeling time.

The two nested ```if()``` statements make sure we do not count reproductively active females in the reference category. To do this, for any female we find the month of her first calf, and, using some indexing, we set all her health values to NA for the time following her first calf up until the time she encounters her first entanglement. This ensures that the "unentangled" state does not include natural variation from health in reproductive females. Note that when doing this updating of the health, I first check that the first calf (```t1```) comes before the first entanglement (```t2```). If yes, then the health for this period -- reproductively active but not _yet_ entangled -- is not included in the unentangled reference class.

And then we plot it:

```{r}
plot(dateVec, fate[1, ], type = 'l', ylim = c(0, 4), col = "#00000050", ylab = 'Entanglement State', las = 1, xlab = 'Year')
for(i in 2:nrow(fate)){
  lines(dateVec, fate[i, ], col = "#00000050")
}
```

## Sample and Plot Health
With the state/fate vectors complete for each individual animal, we use those in conjunction with the health data to gauge how health of different classes of animals changes.

To get the fate data married with the health data, we:

1. loop over the columns in that health matrix (n.b. that each row corresponds to an animal, each column corresponds to a specific month)
2. tally the number of animals in each class from ```fate```
3. intersect ```fate``` with ```health``` to get the summary statistics (mean, sd) from each grouping at each time

```{r}
dfAll <- numeric(0)
health <- healthmean[noquote(rownames(healthmean)) %in% ID, ]

for (i in 1:ncol(health)){
  df <- data.frame(id = ID, health = health[, i], fate = fate[, i], dateTime = dateVec[i])
  dfSummary <- df %>% 
    group_by(fate) %>% 
    summarize(mean = mean(health, na.rm = TRUE), 
              sd = sd(health, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    mutate(time = i) %>% 
    mutate(dateTime = dateVec[i])
  dfAll <- rbind(dfAll, dfSummary)
}
```

Ok, with it assembled, let's try and plot it out.

```{r}
mypal <- brewer.pal(3, 'Reds')
unentangled <- dfAll %>% filter(fate == 4)
minor <- dfAll %>% filter(fate == 3)
moderate <- dfAll %>% filter(fate == 2)
severe <- dfAll %>% filter(fate == 1)

plot(unentangled$dateTime, unentangled$mean, type = 'l', lwd = 2, ylim = c(0, 100), 
     xlim = c(as.Date('1980-01-01'), as.Date("2014-07-01")),
     xlab = 'Date',  ylab = "Estimated Health Score")
lines(unentangled$dateTime, unentangled$mean + unentangled$sd, col = "#00000050")
lines(unentangled$dateTime, unentangled$mean - unentangled$sd, col = "#00000050")

lines(minor$dateTime, minor$mean, lty = 1, col = mypal[1], lwd = 2)
# lines(minor$dateTime, minor$mean + minor$sd, lty = 2, col = mypal[1])
# lines(minor$dateTime, minor$mean - minor$sd, lty = 2, col = mypal[1])

lines(moderate$dateTime, moderate$mean, lty = 1, col = mypal[2], lwd = 2)
# lines(moderate$dateTime, moderate$mean + moderate$sd, lty = 2, col = mypal[2])
# lines(moderate$dateTime, moderate$mean - moderate$sd, lty = 2, col = mypal[2])

lines(severe$dateTime, severe$mean, lty = 1, col = mypal[3], lwd = 2)
# lines(severe$dateTime, severe$mean + severe$sd, lty = 2, col = mypal[3])
# lines(severe$dateTime, severe$mean - severe$sd, lty = 2, col = mypal[3])
legend( "bottomright", col = c('black', mypal), legend = c("Unentangled", 'Minor', "Moderate", 'Severe'), lty = 1, lwd = 2)
```

The above needs additional data for context -- namely how many whales are in each state at each time. Let's add that below. First we tally it and then convert it to a normalized matrix that shows the percentage of animals in each class.

```{r}
tallyList <- lapply(split(fate, col(fate)), table)

tmat <- matrix(NA, nrow = 4, ncol(fate))
for(i in 1:ncol(fate)){
  vdat <- as.vector(unlist(tallyList[[i]]))
  vidx <- noquote(names(unlist(tallyList[[i]])))
  tmat[match(vidx, 1:4), i] <- vdat
}
tpct <- 100 * (tmat / colSums(tmat, na.rm = TRUE))
```

With that assembled we can plot the raw numbers:

```{r}
plot(dateVec, tmat[4, ], ylim = c(0, 700), type = 'l', panel.first = 
       c(abline(h = seq(0, 700, 100), lty = 3, col = 'grey') 
        ,abline(v = as.Date(c("1980-01-01", "1985-01-01", "1990-01-01", "1995-01-01", "2000-01-01", "2005-01-01", "2010-01-01")), 
                lty = 3, col = 'grey')),
     xlim = c(as.Date('1980-01-01'), as.Date("2014-07-01")), 
     xlab = 'Date/Time', ylab = 'Number of Animals', las = 1, lwd = 2)
lines(dateVec, tmat[1, ], ylim = c(0, 700), col = mypal[3], lwd = 2)
lines(dateVec, tmat[2, ], ylim = c(0, 700), col = mypal[2], lwd = 2)
lines(dateVec, tmat[3, ], ylim = c(0, 700), col = mypal[1], lwd = 2)
legend( "topright", col = c('black', mypal), legend = c("Unentangled", 'Minor', "Moderate", 'Severe'), lty = 1, lwd = 2)
```

and the normalized values:
```{r}
plot(dateVec, tpct[4, ], ylim = c(0, 100), type = 'l', panel.first = 
       c(abline(h = seq(0, 100, 10), lty = 3, col = 'grey') 
        ,abline(v = as.Date(c("1980-01-01", "1985-01-01", "1990-01-01", "1995-01-01", "2000-01-01", "2005-01-01", "2010-01-01")), 
                lty = 3, col = 'grey')),xlim = c(as.Date('1980-01-01'), as.Date("2014-07-01")), 
     xlab = 'Date/Time', ylab = '% of Animals', las = 1, lwd = 2)
lines(dateVec, tpct[1, ], col = mypal[3], lwd = 2)
lines(dateVec, tpct[2, ], col = mypal[2], lwd = 2)
lines(dateVec, tpct[3, ], col = mypal[1], lwd = 2)
legend( "topright", col = c('black', mypal), legend = c("Unentangled", 'Minor', "Moderate", 'Severe'), lty = 1, lwd = 2)
```
